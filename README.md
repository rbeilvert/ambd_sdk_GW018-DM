# AmebaD SDK adjusted for Tuya GW018-DM gateway
The purpose of this is to cut the GW108-DM gateway from the cloud and use it as Zigbee Adapter in HomeAssistant (e. g. via Zigbee2MQTT). The firmware is basically the same as https://github.com/parasite85/rtl_firmware, but with some small adjustments for AmebaD (WBRG1 module, RTL8721CSM) instead of Ameba1 (WRG1 module, RTL8711AM) based on the discussion [here](https://github.com/MattWestb/EFR32-FW/issues/6).

**Work in Progress! Use this at your own risk! And consider making a backup before!**

## 1) Connect to the device via UART
Open up the plastic case and remove the single screw. Solder pin headers to the PCB in P1 area. Connect them with jumper cables to a UART-TTL to USB adapter. Pin assignment is from left (outer edge) to right:

* GND -> connect to GND on UART adapter
* TX -> connect to RX on UART adapter
* RX -> connect to TX on UART adapter
* VCC (?) -> don't connect anything here

Plugin the UART-TTL to USB adapter into your computer's USB port.

## 2) Make a backup of the Realtek's chip external flash
You need to get into a special "command mode" in order to create a backup. We need to communicate to the gateway via UART to do that. I'm using minicom for that purpose:
```
# install it first – use your system's package manager
sudo dnf install minicom
# now start it and connect to the gateway – use the right device path, in my case it's /dev/ttyUSB0
minicom -b 115200 -D /dev/ttyUSB0
```
If you plug in the UART adapter into your computer's USB port and connect the gateway to power afterwards, you will see the boot messages of your gateway flickering on the screen. 

You'll have to do it the other way round in order to get into the command mode: Leave minicom open, unplug the gateway from power and the UART adapter from your PC – then reconnect it: This time power on the gateway first and plugin the UART adapter second. You will see nothing but a blinking cursor – but that's how it should be!

Now enter minicom settings (pressing "ctrl" + "a" and then "o") and disable hardware flow control by entering "Serial port setup" and pressing "f". Press enter, close settings. Now press and hold ESC – if everything works fine, a shell "#" will pop up. You can type in "?" and press enter to see a list of available commmands:
```

----------------- COMMAND MODE END  ------------------
#
```
We want to make a dump of the flash – so the "flash read" command would be the right one. But wait: We have to save the output somewhere. So press "ctrl" + "a" again followed by "l" to save minicom log in a file. Name it like you want and press enter. Let's read the flash (found address and length by trial and error):
```
flash read 0 2097152
```
And the flash will be printed as hex code on your screen. This might take a while. Have a coffee or a nap in the meantime. Exit minicom afterwards by pressing "ctrl" + "a" followed by "x", open the logfile in a text editor, make sure you only keep the dump (starting with `00000000:` and ending with `007ffff0: 7c8bfc05 b410f5f8  14a25132 5f239f20` in my case) and save it. Then convert it into a binary file (maybe there is a much cleaner way to do this – I just could'nt find any):
```
awk -F' ' '{print $2$3$4$5}' myfirmwaredump.cap | xxd -r -p | xxd -e | awk -F' ' '{print $2$3$4$5}' | xxd -r -p > wbrg1-firmware.bin
```
Congratulations! You now have a backup and theoretically you can restore it (or parts of it) using ImageTool in case anything goes wrong.

## 3) Build the new firmware
Now it's time to clone this repo, install the needed dependencies and build the gateway's new firmware out of the AmebaD sdk :)
```
# Dependencies: on a 64-bit host, make is all you actually need.
sudo dnf install make          # Fedora
sudo apt install make          # Debian/Ubuntu

# Shallow-clone: the full history is ~1.6 GB.
git clone --depth 1 --single-branch --branch dev \
  https://github.com/jasperw1996/ambd_sdk_GW018-DM

cd ambd_sdk_GW018-DM/project/realtek_amebaD_va0_example/GCC-RELEASE/project_lp/
make all
cd ../project_hp/
make all
```

**On the 32-bit packages.** Earlier revisions of this README asked for
`glibc-devel.i686` and `ncurses-compat-libs.i686`. Those belong to the i686
fallback path only. The toolchain is not a system package and is not committed
as a binary: `project_hp/toolchain/asdk/` holds split archives that
`toolchain/Makefile` concatenates and unpacks on the first build, and it
branches on `uname -p`. An `x86_64` host therefore gets
`asdk-6.4.1-linux-newlib-build-3026-x86_64`, which is a genuine 64-bit ELF
running `arm-none-eabi-gcc 6.4.1` -- no multilib involved. Verified by building
both cores from a clean clone on x86_64 Ubuntu with only `make` installed.

**If you clone with the GitHub CLI configured for SSH,** plain
`git clone https://...` can fail with `could not read Username for
'https://github.com'`, which looks like a private repository but is not. Use
`gh repo clone jasperw1996/ambd_sdk_GW018-DM -- --depth 1` instead. Note that
`gh` also adds the `Seeed-Studio/seeed-ambd-sdk` upstream remote and fetches
its refs, which takes the working copy from ~1.6 GB to ~2.3 GB on disk.
If everything goes fine, you should see a `========== Image manipulating end ==========` at the end of each make process.

**About "error 127".** It is `command not found`: the bundled helper scripts
the Makefiles invoke had lost their execute bit in the tree. That is now fixed
at the source -- the 27 `.sh` scripts under `GCC-RELEASE/` are committed mode
`100755` -- so the `chmod -R 777 ./` workaround should no longer be necessary.
If you do hit it, prefer a targeted fix over recursive 777, which also marks
data files, `.bin` images and `.txt` GDB scripts executable:
```
find . -name '*.sh' -exec chmod +x {} \;
make clean && make all
```

Finally you'll have a bunch of images in the `asdk/image` subdirectory of
`project_lp` and `project_hp`. Three of them are needed in the next step. For a
reference build of this branch they come out as:

| image | bytes | from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `km0_boot_all.bin` | 4144 | `project_lp/asdk/image/` |
| `km4_boot_all.bin` | 4208 | `project_hp/asdk/image/` |
| `km0_km4_image2.bin` | 663552 | `project_hp/asdk/image/` |

`km0_km4_image2.bin` is written into *both* image directories and the two
copies are byte-identical, so either will do. The KM4 pass also prints
`size = 663552` and `checksum 3f83757` as it finishes, which is a free
sanity check on your own build.

## 4) Flash the firmware to the gateway
You can flash the new firmware to the gateway using Realtek ImageTool – there is a GUI for windows, but you might also use the Linux CLI from AmebaD Arduino SDK. Choose whatever you prefer :)

### a) Flash using ImageTool CLI (Linux)
Download the [CLI executable from AmebaD Arduino SDK](https://github.com/ambiot/ambd_arduino/raw/dev/Arduino_package/ameba_d_tools_linux/upload_image_tool_linux). Grab `km0_boot_all.bin` from `project_lp` as well as `km4_boot_all.bin` and `km0_km4_image2.bin` from `project_hp` out of your build's image folders and put them in the same directory as the ImageTool executable. 

The ImageTool for Linux can put your device into UART download mode automatically. All you have to do is connecting your gateway to your computer like you did before: Power up the gateway first and plugin the USB UART adapter to your computer afterwards. Then start flashing (make sure that your USB UART adapter supports a baudrate of `921600`):
```
# make the executable executable if you have not done so before:
chmod +x upload_image_tool_linux

# Erase flash before flashing new firmware (may not be needed)
./upload_image_tool_linux "$PWD" /dev/ttyUSB0 ameba_rtl8721csm Enable Enable 921600

# … and let's flash!
./upload_image_tool_linux "$PWD" /dev/ttyUSB0 ameba_rtl8721csm Enable Disable 921600
```
You can see in the logs if the flashing process went well. If not – just flash it again, as long as you stay in `UART_DOWNLOAD` mode, everything should be fine. Make sure that flashing succeeded, then power off the gateway. Fire up minicom and power on the gateway again. You should see some boot logs again, containing `!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hello from KM0 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!` and `!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hello from KM4 1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!`. After a few seconds, you'll get a shell and can connect to your WiFi.

### b) Flash using ImageTool GUI (Windows)

To prepare the flashing process you will have to reenter "Command Mode". Then, in minicom, after disabling hardware flow control again, type in `reboot uartburn` and press enter to put the device into `UART_DOWNLOAD` mode.

In the next step, you'll need a Windows 7 (+) environment to make use of the [ImageTool.exe from the original AmebaD SDK repo](https://github.com/ambiot/ambd_sdk/raw/dev/tools/AmebaD/Image_Tool/ImageTool.exe). Use a virtual machine or a Windows installation on a different device.

Install .NET Framework 3.5, the drivers for your UART adapter and open ImageTool.exe. Click "Chip Select" and choose "AmebaD". Set baudrate to `115200` or `921600` (faster), if your UART USB adapter supports it. If your gateway is still in `UART_DOWNLOAD` mode and all drivers are installed correctly, you should see your UART adapter as a COM port.

The new firmware is smaller than the old firmware, that's why I erased some parts of the flash manually – this may not be needed, but I think it's "cleaner" (?):
1) Erase 16 KB starting from `0x08000000`
2) Erase 8 KB starting from `0x08004000`
3) Erase 1224 KB starting from `0x08006000`

Now grab `km0_boot_all.bin` from `project_lp` as well as `km4_boot_all.bin` and `km0_km4_image2.bin` from `project_hp` out of your build's image folders, put them on your Windows machine and select them in ImageTool:

![ImageTool settings](imagetool.png)

Click on "Download", wish the best and wait a minute :) You can see in the logs if the flashing process went well. If not – just flash it again, as long as you stay in `UART_DOWNLOAD` mode, everything should be fine. Make sure that flashing succeeded, then power off the gateway. Connect it to your Linux machine again, fire up minicom and power on the gateway. You should see some boot logs again, containing `!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hello from KM0 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!` and `!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hello from KM4 1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!`. After a few seconds, you'll get a shell and can connect to your WiFi.


## 5) Connect your gateway to WiFi
At this point, the procedure is nearly identical to the [WRG1 hack](https://github.com/parasite85/tuya_tygwzw1_hack). Type in your WiFi SSID, your passphrase and connect:
```
ATW0=myWifiName
ATW1=myWifiPassword
ATWC

# copy your gateway's IP address out of the log –
# you'll need it in the next step!
# … and maybe reboot afterwards

reboot
```

## 6) Use your gateway as adapter in Zigbee2MQTT

After a reboot, your gateway will automatically connect to your WiFi and prepare everything needed to use it as an adapter in Zigbee2MQTT.

Make sure you see `Example: socket tx/rx 1` in the logs. Then open Zigbee2MQTT configuration in HomeAssistant and fill in the details for your adapter (take the IP you got from the logs in step 5):
```
serial:
  adapter: ezsp
  baudrate: 115200
  port: tcp://<your-gateway-ip>:80
  rtscts: true
```
Note that `adapter: ezsp` is Zigbee2MQTT's deprecated driver, kept for
EmberZNet 7.3 and older. The maintained `ember` driver needs a ZS3L NCP built
from EmberZNet 7.4.x or newer (EZSP v13); an 8.x NCP additionally wants a
recent zigbee-herdsman. If you flash a modern NCP in step 7b, switch `adapter`
to `ember` here.

Start the Zigbee2MQTT addon – and it will try to connect to your gateway. For me, this is working pretty stable now. If you get an error like this, wait a few seconds, restart the addon and try again until it's working :)
```
[2024-07-31 15:33:25] error: 	zh:ezsp:uart: --> Error: Error: {"sequence":-1} after 10000ms

```
## 7) Update your gateway over-the-air
After flashing this firmware to your gateway, you can update/push new firmware files to your device via WiFi. Please note that you have to update the WBRG1 module (the one this repo is made for) and the ZS3L module separately.

### a) Update WBRG1 module

For updating the WBRG1's Realtek chip, I enabled the [OTA update example](https://github.com/jasperw1996/ambd_sdk_GW018-DM/blob/dev/component/common/example/ota_http/example_ota_http.c) and changed a few lines. (If you don't need it, you can disable it by setting `CONFIG_EXAMPLE_OTA_HTTP` to `0` in [platform_opts.h](https://github.com/jasperw1996/ambd_sdk_GW018-DM/blob/dev/project/realtek_amebaD_va0_example/inc/inc_hp/platform_opts.h)).

Set the `HOST` variable in the [OTA update example](https://github.com/jasperw1996/ambd_sdk_GW018-DM/blob/dev/component/common/example/ota_http/example_ota_http.c) to the IP address or hostname of your computer. Then rebuild the firmware. Go to the image folder in `project/realtek_amebaD_va0_example/GCC-RELEASE/project_hp/asdk/image`, open a terminal there and start a webserver of your choice serving that directory:
```
# use a simple python http server …
python3 -m http.server 8080

# … or maybe NGINX with docker or podman
podman run --rm -it --name nginx-firmware-server -p 8080:80 -v ../image:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro docker.io/nginx:stable
```
Now start the gateway, wait until the blue LED stops blinking, press the reset button for 3-4 seconds and release. You should see your gateway connecting to your webserver a few seconds later, downloading the `OTA_All.bin` firmware file in your image folder. It reboots automatically afterwards – and if everything worked fine, you should see the blue LED blinking for a few seconds again.

### b) Update ZS3L module
Now that your Zigbee chip's UART connection is exposed via WBRG1 module to your WiFi, you can update its firmware over-the-air, too. We could use the good old "xmodem" protocol for that. 

If you want to learn more about that, you could enter the bootloader of your Zigbee chip manually and use "xmodem" directly, e. g. with minicom. But there are also a bunch of tools out there to automate this. I successfully tried NabuCasa's [Universal Silabs Flasher](https://github.com/NabuCasa/universal-silabs-flasher):
```
universal-silabs-flasher --device socket://<your-gateway-ip>:80 flash --firmware "/path/to/your/gecko-bootloader-firmware-file.gbl"
```
I built a new, but still buggy firmware (and also created a .gbl file of the stock firmware you can flash back) [here](https://github.com/MattWestb/EFR32-FW/issues/6#issuecomment-2275368851). But you could also create one yourself using "Simplicity Studio" (to create a .bin file) and "Simplicity Commander" (to convert the .bin to .gbl afterwards).

For me, the flashing process hangs at 100% – it seems to work fine, though: If I wait only a few seconds and then repower the device, the Zigbee chip boots up with the new firmware.

**Please note that there is always a risk that you can (soft-)brick your device while flashing a new firmware to it. Do it at your own risk! You might need your USB UART adapter again or an SWD debugger for the ZS3L module in case anything goes wrong.**

## Repository notes

**`.gitignore`.** A build leaves ~1700 generated files in the working tree, so
the repository now ignores them. The rules are deliberately narrow where a
blanket pattern would be wrong:

* `*.o`, `*.d`, `*.su`, `*.i` are matched globally -- the build scatters these
  both inside `asdk/make/` and alongside the sources under `component/`, and
  the tree tracks no files with those extensions.
* Generated `.s` listings are scoped to `asdk/make/` rather than ignored
  globally, because 19 hand-written `.s` sources are tracked elsewhere in the
  SDK. For the same reason `*.a` is not ignored at all: 27 prebuilt static
  libraries are tracked.
* The extracted toolchain (`project_*/toolchain/{linux,cygwin,darwin}/`) and
  the concatenated `toolchain/asdk/*.tar.bz2` are ignored, while the split
  `*.tar.bz2a|b|c` parts stay tracked -- they are the source the build unpacks.
* `asdk/build/`, `asdk/image/` and the regenerated `inc_*/build_info.h` stamps.

**Executable bits.** The 27 `.sh` scripts under `GCC-RELEASE/` are committed
mode `100755`, which is the actual fix for the "error 127" described in step 3.
